<a href="https://github.com/Learn-NEAR/NCD.L1.sample--lottery" target="_blank">NCD.L1.sample--lottery smart contract</a> targeting the NEAR platform:
1. Vue.Js (main branch)
2. React (react branch)
3. Angular (angular branch)

The example here is playful. It's a toy involving a lottery.
The goal of this repository is to make it as easy as possible to get started writing frontend with VueJs and React for AssemblyScript contracts built to work with NEAR Protocol.

You can use this app with contract id`s which was deployed by creators of this repo,  or you can use it with your own deployed  contractId.
If you are using not yours contractId some functions of the lottery contract will not work because  they are setted to work  only  if owner called this  functions.

To get possibility to work with the full functionality of the smart contract, you need to paste your contractId inside UI of VueJs deployed dapp or React deployed dapp.
Before pasting id make sure that you deployed correct smart contract, in other case this code may  not work as expected.
